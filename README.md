# Riders
Rider is a native android application which helps passengers to make their ride contracts with drivers.The main motivation behind this project is to build trust among drivers and passengers because other ride hailing solutions provide anonymous rides where a passenger doesn't know who is going to pick me up which could affect his/her safety.We are assuming that once a same driver will be responsible to pick and drop the passenger during the contract, they start trusting each other and will enjoy good ride experiance.
# Main Functionalities
- Ride Booking.
- Real time location tracking on Google Maps.
- Notifying passengers about their contracts status.
- Enabling passengers to search drivers in their current cities.
- Search for a specific vehicle.
